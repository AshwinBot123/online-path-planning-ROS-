3D-OGSE is a sample-based motion planning algorithm that generates path from current position to goal position in unknown 3D environment with static obstacle.
It samples random point in free space using shape classifier function then it construct graph in free space and plans path between current position and goal position
This method is computationally efficient, guarantees collision-free paths.
